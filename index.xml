      <description>In continuation to my previous medium post Native Android in Unity and Native Android text sharing in Unity, will consider another example of native Android screenshot sharing functionality in the unity app.   If you have not read the previous medium posts, I would strongly recommend to read them first. You can read them on the links below.  Native Android in Unity Native Android text sharing in Unity   As the number says, an image gains more attention than a normal text while sharing.</description>

      <description>In continuation to my previous medium post Native Android in Unity, will consider another example of native Android text sharing functionality in the unity app. This is a very common requirement in any unity app targeting Android platform to share the high score or challenge other players with a text message or a screenshot of the high score. The sharing can be done via any of the app available on the user’s device which supports sharing.</description>

      <description>We all know about three classes Any, Unit and Nothing in Kotlin which have their own functionality and use cases but we usually confuse between the differences among them and when to use what.   Let try to understand what are these, when to use what and how these are different from one another.    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});    Any  Any is an open class and by default the superclass for all the classes, whether we define it explicitly or not.</description>

      <description>After reading my last blog about let scope function in Kotlin, a lot of developers have asked me about, why let is an extension to Template class but not Any class?   Not only let, but other helper functions like apply, also, takeIf and takeUnless are also extension functions to the Template class.    The question is why?   Any is the base class for all the class, similar to java.</description>

      <description>Kotlin has made our life very easy by providing features like extension functions, nullability check and much more. One such kind of really helpful feature is Scope functions. Once you understand what scope functions are, you will not able to resist yourself from using them.   Scope functions are nothing but the functions which define to the scope of the calling object. We can apply operations on that object within that scope and return the object itself from that scope function or we can even return the result of operation or operations from the scope function.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;how are extension functions resolved?&amp;rdquo;  This question is being asked by almost everyone both in and outside the interviews.  Even I have asked this question to many candidates during the interview.  The shorted or the only answer I get is &amp;ldquo;Statically&amp;rdquo;.   What does statically means?  Or how does extension functions are actually resolved?   Let&amp;rsquo;s understand this with an example.  Consider we have two classes BaseClass and DerivedClass.</description>

      <title>Variable number of arguments (vararg) : Kotlin</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/variable-number-of-arguments-vararg-kotlin/</link>

      <description>Sometimes we need a function where we can pass n number of parameters, and the value of n can be decided at runtime. Kotlin provides us to achieve the same by defining a parameter of a function as vararg. We can pass n number of parameters to a vararg variable of the defined datatype or even of a generic type.   Let me give you an example.   We need a function which takes n number as inputs and returns the average of all the inputs.</description>

      <title>lateinit property in Kotlin</title>

      <guid>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/lateinit-property-in-kotlin/</guid>
      <description>There can be two ways to declare and initialize a var property  
 var variable : CustomClass = CustomClass()  orvar variable : CustomClass? = null  The first property is initialized while declaration itself and doesn’t require a null check (?.) while using it.  But in the second type, the property is initialized with a null value and will require a null check (?.) always while using it.</description>

      <title>Property, Getter and Setter — Kotlin</title>

      <description>I started developing Android apps in Java where encapsulation of object-oriented programming was achieved through declaring variables as private fields with their getter and setter as public methods. The moment I converted my Java code to Kotlin, it replaced each variable along with its getter and setter with just a single line of code. Although I was amazed at how can a single line of code replace the complete variable with the same functionality, but later on understanding it, I started liking writing the code in Kotlin.</description>

      <title>Safe calls(?.) vs Null checks(!!) in Kotlin</title>

      <description>In Kotlin, the type system distinguishes between references that can hold null (nullable references) and those that can not (non-null references).  For example, a normal property can’t hold a null value and will show a compile error.  
 var variable : CustomClass = CustomClass()variable = null //compilation error  Instead, we can add a ? after the data type of that property which declares that variable as a nullable property</description>

      <title>Equality in Kotlin (‘==’, ‘===’ and ‘equals’)</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/equality-in-kotlin/</link>

      <description>We often need to compare the data of two variables or objects or the references of two objects in Kotlin. This brings in another question, which equality check should we use in which case.  Let’s figure out what are the types of checks available in Kotlin.      Structural Equality (‘==’)  == operator is used to compare the data of two variables.  Please don’t misunderstand this equality operator with the Java == operator as both are different.</description>

      <title>Companion object in Kotlin</title>

      <description>Unlike Java or C#, Kotlin doesn’t have static members or member functions. Kotlin recommends to simply use package-level functions instead.  If you need to write a function that can be called without having a class instance but needs access to the internals of a class, you can write it as a member of a companion object declaration inside that class. By declaring a companion object inside our class, you’ll be able to call its members with the same syntax as calling static methods in Java/C#, using only the class name as a qualifier.</description>

      <title>Backing Field in Kotlin</title>

      <guid>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/backing-field-in-kotlin/</guid>
      <description>What is Backing Field ? 
Backing field is an autogenerated field for any property which can only be used inside the accessors(getter or setter) and will be present only if it uses the default implementation of at least one of the accessors, or if a custom accessor references it through the field identifier. This backing field is used to avoid the recursive call of an accessor which ultimately prevents the StackOverflowError.</description>

      <description>While developing unity games in C# targeting android platform, we always want to use few native android features in our game. These features can be showing notifications on certain actions in the game or can be sharing the high score with other players and inviting them to try our game using android native share. Android gives us all the possibilities to achieve these native android functionalities in unity app using C#.</description>

      <title>Inheritance vs Extension functions</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/inheritance-vs-extension-functions/</link>

      <guid>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/inheritance-vs-extension-functions/</guid>
      <description>We all know about inheritance which is there in the OOPs concept where one can extend a class and add functionality to it. In the new programming languages, there is something called as extension functions which can add a functionality to an existing class without extending it.  Sometimes we are confused about what to use when. To get help here, one needs to understand first what are these two and what are the benefits and limitations over the other.</description>
