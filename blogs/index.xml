      <description>Kotlin has made our life very easy by providing features like extension functions, nullability check and much more. One such kind of really helpful feature is Scope functions. Once you understand what scope functions are, you will not able to resist yourself from using them.   Scope functions are nothing but the functions which define to the scope of the calling object. We can apply operations on that object within that scope and return the object itself from that scope function or we can even return the result of operation or operations from the scope function.</description>

      <title>How extension functions resolved?</title>

      <description>how does extension functions are actually resolved? This question is being asked by almost everyone both in and outside the interviews. The shorted or the only answer I get is &amp;lsquo;Statically&amp;rsquo;. What does statically means?</description>

      <title>Variable number of arguments (vararg) : Kotlin</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/variable-number-of-arguments-vararg-kotlin/</link>

      <description>Sometimes we need a function where we can pass n number of parameters, and the value of n can be decided at runtime. Kotlin provides us to achieve the same by defining a parameter of a function as vararg. We can pass n number of parameters to a vararg variable of the defined datatype or even of a generic type.   Let me give you an example.   We need a function which takes n number as inputs and returns the average of all the inputs.</description>

      <title>lateinit property in Kotlin</title>

      <description>There can be two ways to declare and initialize a var property. The first property type is initialized while declaration itself and doesn’t require a null check (!!) while using it.</description>

      <title>Property, Getter and Setter — Kotlin</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/property-getter-and-setter-kotlin/</link>

      <guid>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/property-getter-and-setter-kotlin/</guid>
      <description>I started developing Android apps in Java where encapsulation of object-oriented programming was achieved through declaring variables as private fields with their getter and setter as public methods. The moment I converted my Java code to Kotlin, it replaced each variable along with its getter and setter with just a single line of code. Although I was amazed at how can a single line of code replace the complete variable with the same functionality, but later on understanding it, I started liking writing the code in Kotlin.</description>

      <title>Safe calls(?.) vs Null checks(!!) in Kotlin</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/safe-calls-vs-null-checks-in-kotlin/</link>

      <description>In Kotlin, the type system distinguishes between references that can hold null (nullable references) and those that can not (non-null references). For example, a normal property can’t hold a null value and will show a compile error.</description>

      <title>Equality in Kotlin (‘==’, ‘===’ and ‘equals’)</title>

      <description>We often need to compare the data of two variables or objects or the references of two objects in Kotlin. This brings in another question, which equality check should we use in which case.</description>

      <title>Companion object in Kotlin</title>

      <description>Unlike Java or C#, Kotlin doesn’t have static members or member functions. Kotlin recommends to simply use package-level functions instead. If you need to write a function that can be called without having a class instance but needs access to the internals of a class, you can write it as a member of a companion object declaration inside that class.</description>

      <title>Backing Field in Kotlin</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/backing-field-in-kotlin/</link>

      <guid>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/backing-field-in-kotlin/</guid>
      <description>Backing field is an autogenerated field for any property which can only be used inside the accessors(getter or setter) and will be present only if it uses the default implementation of at least one of the accessors, or if a custom accessor references it through the field identifier.</description>

      <description>While developing unity games in C# targeting android platform, we always want to use few native android features in our game. These features can be showing notifications on certain actions in the game or can be sharing the high score with other players and inviting them to try our game using android native share.</description>

      <title>Inheritance vs Extension functions</title>
      <link>https://agrawalsuneet.github.io/blogs/inheritance-vs-extension-functions/</link>

      <description>We all know about inheritance which is there in the OOPs concept where one can extend a class and add functionality to it. In the new programming languages, there is something called as extension functions which can add a functionality to an existing class without extending it.</description>
